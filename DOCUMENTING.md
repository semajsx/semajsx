## Core Principles

1. **Separate concerns**: Formal documents vs. working documents
2. **Organize by purpose**: Tasks by feature, docs by type
3. **Preserve evolution**: Keep valuable history, discard noise
4. **Reduce duplication**: Single source of truth for each topic

## Two Categories of Documents

### Formal Documents (`docs/`)

**Purpose**: Permanent, reviewed, organization-wide significance.

| Type  | Location       | Content                              | Lifecycle                  |
| ----- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| RFC   | `docs/rfcs/`   | Feature proposals, requirements      | Permanent after acceptance |
| ADR   | `docs/adrs/`   | Cross-cutting architecture decisions | Permanent, append-only     |
| Guide | `docs/guides/` | User tutorials (if needed)           | Updated with releases      |

**Characteristics**:

- Reviewed before merge
- Stable after acceptance
- Referenced by multiple tasks
- Formal structure (templates)

### Task Workspaces (`tasks/`)

**Purpose**: Working documents for specific features/tasks.

| File           | Purpose      | Content                                       |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `README.md`    | Final design | API, usage, architecture (authoritative)      |
| `EVOLUTION.md` | History      | Requirements, research, iterations, learnings |
| `adr-*.md`     | Decisions    | Task-specific architectural choices           |
| `research/`    | Analysis     | Competitive analysis, deep dives              |

**Characteristics**:

- Organized by feature/task
- Evolves during development
- Contains both final state and history
- Self-contained (task-scoped)

## Document Lifecycle

### Creation

```
New Task
    │
    ▼
Create tasks/feature-name/
    │
    ├── Start EVOLUTION.md
    │   - Requirement section
    │   - Research section (as you go)
    │
    ├── (Optional) Major feature?
    │   └── Create docs/rfcs/YYYY-MM-feature.md
    │
    └── (Optional) Cross-cutting decision?
        └── Create docs/adrs/NNN-decision.md
```

### Evolution

```
During Development
    │
    ├── Update EVOLUTION.md
    │   - Add research findings
    │   - Document design iterations
    │   - Record decisions with rationale
    │
    ├── Create drafts (in task directory)
    │   - Delete or consolidate when done
    │
    └── Write code + tests
```

### Completion

```
Task Complete
    │
    ├── Finalize README.md (authoritative design)
    │
    ├── Complete EVOLUTION.md
    │   - Add Learnings section
    │   - Clean up prose
    │
    ├── Clean up
    │   - Delete obsolete drafts
    │   - Keep valuable research
    │
    └── Update CHANGELOG.md
```

## EVOLUTION.md Structure

The evolution record captures the journey, not just the destination.

```markdown
# Feature Name - Evolution

## 1. Requirement

- Problem statement
- Success criteria
- Scope boundaries

## 2. Research

- Existing solutions analyzed
- Key findings
- Constraints identified

## 3. Design Iterations

### v1 - Initial Approach

- Description
- Problems discovered

### v2 - Refinement

- Changes from v1
- Rationale

### v3 - Final (see README.md)

- Summary of final approach

## 4. Decisions

- Key choices made
- Alternatives considered
- Trade-offs accepted

## 5. Learnings

- What worked well
- What to do differently
- Knowledge to preserve
```

---

## README.md Structure (Final Design)

The authoritative document for "how it works now."

```markdown
# Feature Name

Brief description.

## API

### `functionName(args)`

Description and usage.

## Architecture

How components interact.

## Usage Examples

// Example code

## Limitations

Known constraints.
```

---

## Document Management

### Promotion

Move valuable content from temporary to permanent locations:

- Research insight → `EVOLUTION.md` Research section
- Design draft → Consolidate into `README.md`
- Repeated decision → Extract to `docs/adrs/`

### Cleanup

After task completion:

- Delete obsolete drafts
- Consolidate scattered notes into `EVOLUTION.md`
- Remove duplicate information
- Keep only valuable research materials

### Consolidation

Periodically:

- Merge related ADRs if they form a coherent topic
- Archive completed tasks that are no longer relevant
- Update cross-references

---

## Relationship Between Documents

```
docs/rfcs/feature.md          tasks/feature/              packages/*/
        │                            │                          │
        │  "What & Why"              │  "How"                   │  "Code"
        │                            │                          │
        └──────────────► README.md ◄─────────────────► Implementation
                         (design)                        (source)
                             │
                             │
                       EVOLUTION.md
                         (history)
```

- **RFC** → Defines requirements (input to task)
- **README.md** → Final design (synced with code)
- **EVOLUTION.md** → How we got here (reference)
- **Code** → Implementation (source of truth for behavior)
