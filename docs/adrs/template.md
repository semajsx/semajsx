## Template Notes

**Remove this section when creating a real ADR**

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:

- Making significant architectural decisions
- Choosing between multiple viable alternatives
- Decisions will have long-term impact
- Need to explain rationale to future developers

### ADR Numbering

- Use sequential numbering: 0001, 0002, 0003, etc.
- Never reuse numbers
- Keep chronological order

### ADR Status Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Initial draft, under discussion
2. **Accepted**: Decision made and approved
3. **Deprecated**: No longer recommended but not replaced
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision (link to new ADR)

### Writing Tips

- **Be concise**: 1-2 pages is ideal
- **Be specific**: Avoid vague language
- **Be honest**: Document trade-offs
- **Be practical**: Focus on actionable information
- **Think future**: Write for people 2 years from now

### Examples of Good ADRs

- ADR-0001: Use Signals for Reactivity
- ADR-0002: Adopt Monorepo with Bun Workspaces
- ADR-0003: TypeScript Native (tsgo) as Default Type Checker
