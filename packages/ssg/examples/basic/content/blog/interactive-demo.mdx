This post demonstrates interactive islands in MDX content.

## What are Islands?

Islands are interactive components that hydrate on the client side while the rest of the page remains static.

<Callout type="info" title="Key Concept">
  Islands provide interactivity without shipping JavaScript for the entire page.
</Callout>

## Interactive Counter

Here's an interactive counter that works after hydration:

<Counter initial={5} />

You can have multiple counters with different initial values:

<Counter initial={0} />

<Counter initial={100} />

## How It Works

<CodeBlock language="typescript" title="Counter.tsx">
  {`export const Counter = island(
  function Counter({ initial = 0 }) {
    const count = signal(initial);
    return (
      <button onClick={() => count.value++}>
        Count: {count}
      </button>
    );
  },
  import.meta.url,
);`}
</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="success" title="Benefits">
  - Static content loads instantly - Only interactive parts need JavaScript - Better performance and
  SEO
</Callout>

## Summary

Islands architecture lets you:

1. Pre-render static content at build time
2. Hydrate only interactive components
3. Reduce JavaScript bundle size
4. Improve page load performance
